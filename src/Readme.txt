DESCRIPTION

ReportGenerator converts coverage reports generated by coverlet, OpenCover, dotCover, Visual Studio, NCover, Cobertura,
JaCoCo, Clover, gcov, or lcov into human readable reports in various formats.

The reports show the coverage quotas and also visualize which lines of your source code have been covered.

ReportGenerator supports merging several coverage files into a single report.

The following output formats are supported by ReportGenerator:

-Html, Html_Light, Html_Dark, Html_BlueRed
-HtmlSummary, HtmlChart, HtmlInline
-HtmlInline_AzurePipelines, HtmlInline_AzurePipelines_Light, HtmlInline_AzurePipelines_Dark
-MHtml
-Clover
-Cobertura
-OpenCover (PRO version only)
-SonarQube
-lcov
-Xml, XmlSummary
-JsonSummary
-Latex, LatexSummary
-TeamCitySummary
-TextSummary, TextDeltaSummary
-CsvSummary
-MarkdownSummary, MarkdownSummaryGithub, MarkdownDeltaSummary
-PngChart
-Badges
-Custom formats (https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator/wiki/Custom-reports)

Compatibility:

-OpenCover, coverlet, altcover
-dotCover
-Visual Studio (vstest.console.exe, CodeCoverage.exe)
-NCover (tested version 1.5.8, other versions may not work)
-Cobertura
-JaCoCo (version 0.8.3 or greater)
-Clover
