### Attention
The [Publish Code Coverage Results](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/tree/master/Tasks/PublishCodeCoverageResultsV1) task from Microsoft regenerates the report with different settings and based on the supplied _Coberatura_ file (see [announcement](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/release-notes/2019/sprint-150-update#cobertura-code-coverage-report-updates)). Moreover it does not necessarily use the latest version of _ReportGenerator_.  
To disable the regeneration of the report, you can use the following environment variable in your build:
```yaml
disable.coverage.autogenerate: 'true'
```
